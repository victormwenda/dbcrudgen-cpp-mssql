Added:
    Support for Debian 9
    Improved performance of driver character conversion from utf16
    Changed narrow functions of ODBC API to be sensitive to platform encoding, and not assume UTF-8. Wide encoding is expected to be UTF-16LE

13.1.9.0 - 2017/06/14

Known Issues:
 None

Known Issues:
- Due to the buffer overrun fix (#10034310, see below), UTF-8 non-ASCII
  characters may cause column truncation after conversion to UTF-16. In
  particular, use of SQLBulkOperations with column bindings may cause
  this to occur. A future release will fully support UTF-8. See
  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/linux/known-issues-in-this-version-of-the-driver
  for more information.
